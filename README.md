# _Boots On the Ground_

#### _Complex AI battles_

#### By _**Emerson Jordan**_

## Description

_Players place AI units with complex abilities and upgrades in formations and watch as the battle unfolds.

I did this this project to learn the skills involved in making a complex deterministic scalable online multiplayer game in MVC
using dependency injection. 
Once I had achieved this learning I did not pursue this project further.

Unit creation is based on attaching ability scripts to target-selection scripts.
This is a modular system that makes it possible to create dynamic units that had multiple behaviors that
operate based on multiple conditions simultaneously.

The inspiration for this project was complex AI interactions, and I decided I wanted to preempt any limitation I might unknowingly create in the engine;
so the first thing I did was spent a week coming up with a list of 150 of the most complex and bizzare-ly behaving units I could brainstorm.
I then abstracted these and created the ability interface and target priority system that I used as the basis for unit creation.

## Technologies Used
